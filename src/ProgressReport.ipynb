    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This report aims to provide a summary of the work we did when doing the research and development of the Sentiment Analysis on Icelandic text. Given the research-oriented nature of our project, as opposed to corporate work, we opted for a Kanban approach rather than Scrum. We started well in advance, with initial preparations and research activities commencing in late July to early August. This timeframe allowed us to familiarize ourselves with the intricacies of machine learning, particularly since only one team member possessed prior experience in Machine Learning and Deep Learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've allocated a collective 40 hours per week for all team members, distributed across a span of 20 weeks, aiming to complete this project within this timeframe. This amounts to a total of 800 hours dedicated to the project. \n",
    "We used Discord for communication and had a three weekly standup meetings that were mandatory, but sometimes we added more meetings when needed. GitHub was the repository we used to store the Jupyter Notebooks and Python scripts we used and the CSV dataset as well. JIRA was used to create tasks and plan the work needed. We set specific goals before each status meeting, which were held in October, November and December and this document will go into detail summarizing the work we did.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The project is a research project that aims to evaluate the performance of Icelandic sentiment analysis models trained on translated data using Google Translate and Miðeind Translate. The project is supervised by Stefán Ólafsson and Hrafn Loftsson. Output of the project is expected to be a research paper, dataset, and trained models."

    "\n",
    "The project was initially started by Eysteinn and Ólafur Aron communicating through email to find a team member to work with in the final project, Eysteinn had been working on a project relating to Neural Networks and had an idea if we should do something similar for this project. Soon afterwards Birkir and Júlíus also joined as team members for the project. We created the Discord channel for communication at this stage.\n",

    "\n",
    "We got into contact with Hrafn Loftsson at Reykjavik University and told him we wanted to work on something relating to Neural Networks. He told us to find a few ideas and bring them to him, we started brainstorming and talking on Discord and after some sessions the ideas that we proposed to him were:\n",

    "- Text simplification idea for Icelandic\n",
    "- AI to fix vocabulary and spelling\n",
    "- GameQA extension\n",
    "- Sentiment analysis\n",

    "- Automatic classification of emails with AI\n",
    "\n",
    "Hrafn suggested that we focus on Sentiment Analysis, this was in early August and soon after we had a meeting with him to talk about the ideas.\n",

    "\n",
    "In early September we created the GitHub repository and also the JIRA board, it was also decided at that particular time that we would use Kanban mainly because it was difficult to exactly plan sprints and tasks before-hand so we opted out of a Scrum approach. We also got into contact with Sigurjón Ingi our supervisor and had a meeting with him at that point.\n",

    "\n",
    "It was decided with Hrafn that we would use the IMDB dataset (https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/) which is a known dataset of 50.000 reviews split into positive and negative, so we started to experiment using the Google Trans API and the Vélþýðing API in Python to manually machine translate all of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We had some issues with the Vélþýðing API but after we figured out how to solve them we started to research how the dataset should be processed and lemmatized (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmatization)\n",

    "Each of us were assigned tasks to research classifiers, Birkir was researching Logistic Regression, Ólafur Naive Bayes, Júlíus Word Vector and Eysteinn was looking into IceBERT, it took some time to setup the pipelines for the classifiers but we setup a pipeline with default parameters of Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression and SVC. It was decided to not delve deeper into Word Vectors because at this point Júlíus decided to leave the project so we were three left.\n",
