    "\n",
    "This report aims to provide a summary of the work we did when doing the research and development of the Sentiment Analysis on Icelandic text. To give a thorough and well accounted timeline of everything we did from the idea-preparation to implementation phases. We started well in advance, with initial preparations and research activities commencing in late July to early August. This timeframe allowed us to familiarize ourselves with the intricacies of machine learning, particularly since only one team member possessed prior experience in Machine Learning and Deep Learning.\n",

The project is supervised by Stefán Ólafsson and Hrafn Loftsson and examined by Sigurjón Ingi Garðarsson. Output of the project is expected to be a research paper, dataset, and trained models."

    "# Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the research-oriented nature of our project, as opposed to corporate work, we opted for a Kanban approach rather than a Scrum approach and had set specific deliverables when we handed in the initial project proposal. We allocated a collective 40 hours per week for all team members, distributed across a span of 20 weeks, aiming to complete this project within this timeframe. This amounts to a total of 800 hours dedicated to the project. We also set specific goals before each status meeting, which were held in October, November and December. As the project went on, we amended the goals with regards to the time we had, and also when one team member decided to leave the project. We used JIRA to create tasks and plan the work needed and had a burndown chart in Excel to keep track of our hours, which was setup as a 20 week project with 800 hours allocated to it. We also used Discord for communication and had a three weekly standup meetings that were mandatory, but sometimes we added more meetings when needed. GitHub was the repository we used to store the Jupyter Notebooks and Python scripts we used and the CSV dataset as well.\n",

    "\n",
    "The project was initially started by Eysteinn and Ólafur Aron communicating through email to find a team member to work with in the final project, Eysteinn had been working on a project relating to Neural Networks and had an idea if we should do something similar for this project. Soon afterwards Birkir and Júlíus also joined as team members for the project. We created the Discord channel for communication at this stage.\n",

    "\n",
    "We got into contact with Hrafn Loftsson at Reykjavik University and told him we wanted to work on something relating to Neural Networks.

    "## Initial project proposal\n",
    "\n",
    "We started working on the project proposal to submit to Kári after the meeting and we also started to familiarize ourselves with AI and Machine Learning, around the end of August we sent a project proposal into Canvas which can be seen in the Appendix section (is in Icelandic)\n",

    "# Phase 1 (September)\n",
    "\n",
    "In early September we created the GitHub repository and also the JIRA board, it was also decided at that particular time that we would use Kanban mainly because it was difficult to exactly plan sprints and tasks before-hand so we opted out of a Scrum approach. We also got into contact with Sigurjón Ingi our supervisor and had a meeting with him at that point.\n",

    "\n",
    "Markmið verkefnisins er að þróa hugbúnað sem greinir viðhorf (e. sentiment) í íslenskum texta með beitingu gervigreindar/máltækni.  Mismunandi gervigreindarlíkön verða þjálfuð og metin á íslenskum gögnum. Tvíundarviðhorf (e. binary) verða borin saman við viðhorfsgreiningu á skala (sem dæmi: 1-5).  Í verkefninu verður jafnframt skoðað hvort munur sé á viðhorfsgreiningu  (e. sentiment analysis) líkans sem hefur verið þjálfað á vélþýddum text (frá ensku yfir á íslensku) eða á texta sem hefur verið lagfærður eftir vélþýðingu eða jafnvel skrifaður frá grunni á íslensku.\n",

    "\n",
    "Í verkefninu verður leitast við að viðhorfsgreina íslenskan texta sem ekki hefur verið gert áður en er þekkt viðfangsefni erlendis. Til eru greinar þar sem líkön fyrir viðhorfsgreiningu hafa verið þjálfuð á gögnum eins og kvikmyndagagnrýni úr Internet Movie Database (IMDB). Þar sem engin opin íslensk gögn fyrir viðhorfsgreiningu eru aðgengileg verða gögn úr IMDB vélþýdd yfir á íslensku.  Á sambærilegan hátt verður farið með gögn sem geyma viðhorfsgreiningu á skala, t.d. Amazon Product Reviews.  Skoðaður verður munur á niðurstöðum mismunandi gervigreindarlíkana sem þjálfuð hafa verið á vélþýddum textum og jafnframt borið saman við líkön sem þjálfuð hafa verið á upprunalegum enskum textum.

Þetta hefur aldrei verið gert fyrir íslensku. Niðurstöður okkar verða gefnar út í skýrslu eða vísindagrein sem munu sýna hvort að vélþýðingar séu nógu góðar til að meta viðhorf, eða hvort að íslenska þurfi að vera hreinskrifuð til að meta viðhorf. Kannaðar verða niðurstöður mismunandi líkana á upprunalegan texta og íslenskan texta.\n",
