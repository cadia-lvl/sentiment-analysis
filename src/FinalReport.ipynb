    "Translating English text into low-resource languages and assessing sentiment is a subject that has received extensive research attention for numerous languages, yet Icelandic remains relatively unexplored in this context. We leverage a range of baseline classifiers and deep learning models to investigate whether sentiment can be effectively conveyed across languages, even when employing machine translation services such as Google Translate and Miðeind machine translation.\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this research endeavor, we utilized an IMDB dataset comprising 50,000 reviews, each categorized as either positive or negative in sentiment. Our methodology involved the translation of these reviews using both Google Translate and Miðeind Translate. Subsequently, we subjected all three datasets, including the original English version and the two translations, to analysis using three baseline classifiers. The primary objective was to investigate whether machine translation exerted any influence on the results of sentiment analysis and to determine the superior performer between Miðeind and Google translations. Our aim was to assess the transferability of sentiment across machine translation processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Machine Translations\n",
    "\n",
    "We employed the Google Translator API, which relies on Google's Neural Machine Translation featuring an LSTM architecture. Additionally, we utilized the Miðeind Vélþýðing API for the purpose of machine-translating the reviews. The Miðeind Vélþýðing API is constructed using the multilingual BART model, which was trained using the Fairseq sequence modeling toolkit within the PyTorch framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Google Translate\n",
    "\n",
    "All the reviews were effectively translated using the API, and the only preprocessing step performed on the raw data was the removal of \\<br\\/\\>. The absence of errors during the translation process could be attributed to the API's maturity and extensive user adoption. Nevertheless, it's worth noting that the quality of Icelandic language reviews occasionally exhibited idiosyncrasies.\n",
